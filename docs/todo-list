- Clean-up the list of open issues

- Check all examples are working in new version
    - BN
    - Si
    - MoS2
- Update documentation
    - Write documentation for the flows. Henrique, can you give some feed back here?
    
- Check supercell.py is documented and there is an example. Another option is creating a full workflow for the phonon-assisted calculation

- FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. 
  1. Lattice and Save DBs. Too many repetitions. In SaveDB, we should read lattice-related variables by 
  calling LatticeDB, not defining again identical functions.
  
  2. Unfolding needs some improvements. Rotated supercell.
